          <h1>Woodcrafters Design | A creative manufacturing company</h1>
          <p>
            Growing up in rural northeastern California, Robert Main has been woodworking his entire life.  His inspiration for creating Woodcrafters Design came in 2009 after graduating from college. He began making custom artisan outdoor games tables with intricate wood carvings and beautiful panoramic scenes.
          </p>
          <p>
            After years of crafting by hand, he ventured into building his own CNC routing machine in order to expedite more precise carving of maps and other scenery into redwood. Meet Bob: <a href="http://bobma.in/" target="_blank">Bob Main's portfolio website</a>

      <h1>Computer Numerical Control Router</h1>
      <p>
        The construction of a 12" x 12" CNC Router began with researching required materials and building concepts, and ended with Bob learning Python and C++ to create his own computer program to run his newly-built machine.

      Each mug is a different size and shape due to their individual creation with hours of carving.  The images on each mug were designed, cut into stencils and hand painted onto each mug.  These mugs are sold at farmers markets and artist markets in the Bay Area, California.

    <h1>Functional Artisanal Wood Carving</h1>
    <p>
      One of Bob's first projects was designing and carving a functional block-and-tackle with his CNC Router.  Each piece had to be exactly the same size, shape and diameter. Bob added his own personal touch with carving words and pictures on the side of the block and tackle with his own chosen fonts and design.

    <h1>Tiny Houses and Sheds</h1>
    <p>
      Bob used Google Sketchup to make his dream of a 100 square foot shed in the back yard a reality. The special touches using recycled redwood from a dismantled deck and succulent garden on the roof are his own personal design touches.

      Using a lathe, Bob carved out beautiful reclaimed redwood bracelets. Each bracelet has a different shape, color and texture due to the unique attributes of the wood.
