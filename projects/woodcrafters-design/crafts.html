          </p>
          <p>
            Each cup is varying in size and shape because they're hand-carved.  Each image is unique, designed and hand-painted with a different color scheme each time.  Every cup is made of 100% repurposed redwood and holds cold liquids best.

            These redwood outdoor chairs are easy to fold and carry. They are considered lightweight compared to chairs made of hardwood and they hold up well to any weather.  The table is hand-tiled with recycled tiles and sealed for outdoor use.
